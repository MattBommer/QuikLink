# QuikLink

##### A simple RSS reader for aggregating articles from all your favorite news sources.

## Running QuikLink

Before the iOS app can be run, you must first setup up the backend and run it in your terminal. To do so clone the [QuikLink-Backend](https://github.com/MattBommer/QuikLink-Backend) repo and follow the setup guide listed in the [README.md](https://github.com/MattBommer/QuikLink-Backend/blob/main/README.md)

After configuring and launching the backend locally, open the `.xcworkspace` project file and run the app like normal!
